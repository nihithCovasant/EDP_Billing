"""In-memory state for the mock CBOS v5 server.

Deliberately models the real CBOS invariants that bite in practice:
  - an uploaded chunk lands in a GUID folder that is *orphaned* until a Step-7
    register call associates it with a PROCESSID + UPLOADID;
  - the FILEUPLOAD GTG check only turns TRUE once every *mandatory* upload step
    (non-zero UPLOADID) either has a registered file or has been marked optional
    via Step 8;
  - (V5) a segment/date's PROCESSID is discoverable via
    getdropdown(EXISTINGPROCESSID) and re-fetchable through getNewTradeProcess
    with that PROCESSID - Table2 then reports each slot's *real* STATUS instead
    of resetting to PENDING, which is what makes the uploader's re-scan
    idempotency (skip slots CBOS already accepted) testable here.

Reproducing those rules is the whole point: code that passes here won't be
surprised by the real server.
